## Hi, I'm Soroush
 
A Computer Science student at Shahid Beheshti University. My journey into coding began when I started university, and since then, I've been passionate about exploring the world of technology.

While I believe that time is a great teacher, I also know that personal growth and knowledge are shaped by our experiences and efforts. Currently, I am proficient in several programming languages, but I'm dedicated to continuously improving my skills.

At the moment, I am focusing on Python.

Feel free to connect with me or explore my projects.
